I'm learning to code, so I put up a website using a Jekyll Theme and hosting it on Github. This domain is form a very old website, that I resurrected based on the Wayback Machine. You can see the original site content by clicking the button. Thank you for <a href=“https://www.masonpelt.com”>Mason Pelt</a> for the idea and encouragement to get this website up. You can checkout his <a href=“https://pushroi.com”>web ad agency Push ROI</a> if you need online help.
