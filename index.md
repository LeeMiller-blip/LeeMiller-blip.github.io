I'm learning to code, so I put up a website using a Jekyll Theme and hosting it on Github. This domain is from a very old website, that I resurrected based on the Wayback Machine. You can see the original site content by clicking the button. Thank you to [Mason Pelt](https://www.masonpelt.com) for the idea and encouragement to get this website up. You can checkout his [Dallas marketing agency & video production company](https://pushroi.com) if you need online help.
